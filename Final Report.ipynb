    "#### Background\n",
    "Housing costs have always been a rising concern in California, especially in densely populated major cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. In fact, as the population grows and the housing supply is unable to keep up, California has become the third most expensive state to live in as of 2024.  As housing costs grow, households become more unlikely to spend on other matters, such as education, which will be the main focus of our study. The goal of our study is to find out if we can draw a correlation between the percentage monthly household income paid towards housing costs versus the percentage of adults in an area pursuing a 4-year college degree or higher. In broader strokes, we hope that finding said correlation would display the importance of housing issues by showing such issues can alleviate other issues, starting with education, in California. "

    "#### Hypothesis\n",
    "There exists a correlation between the percentage of households with ‘high’ household burden (30% of household income goes towards housing) and the percentage of individuals in the area pursuing a 4-year college degree or higher within the same area."

    "#### Data\n",
    "We found two datasets for this project from the data provided by the California government. The first one is about [California housing cost burdens](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/housing-cost-burden), with a focus on the variables percentage of income burden in household, county and region. The second dataset should be the [educational attainment dataset](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/educational-attainment), with variables county, region, and estimated percentage of educational attainment in region. Each dataset should have at least 1000 observations to be able to draw accurate estimations, with the housing cost burdens dataset utilizing a sample size of 521,264 and education attainment dataset utilizing a sample size of 166,662. We want to draw a present correlation between housing cost and education from previous historical trends, so both datasets will have a temporal coverage of 2006-2010. "

    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "To make our data useable, we cleaned the data based on our needs. For the educational attainment dataset, we removed the first few rows that aggregate education level by race, since this is not relevant to our goals. For the housing burden dataset, we only kept observations classified under “50% of monthly income…” and “all income levels/monthly income at all levels…income”. We also removed some columns from the table and only kept relevant data such as estimates since the dataset is too large. Afterwards, each person responsible for EDA and testing will further modify the clean data to their own needs, usually to find the mean estimates of each county for the datasets, leaving us with 58 observations."
